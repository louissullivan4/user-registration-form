# user-registration-form
JavaFX user registration form made using Test Driven Development (TDD)

This JavaFX project with TDD is a continous assignment project for Advanced Programming with Java module in my 3rd year of Computer Science.

The idea is that we must make a user registration form with Javafx. I used the scene builder feature to design the form itself. I then used TDD to develop the validation
for both the email and password validation process.

Emails must be well formed and password must reach a certain stength, greater than 7 characters in length, contain a letter and digit and contain a special character.

To run this program just run the Application Main.
